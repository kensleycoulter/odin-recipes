<h5>Bindi Masala</h5>

<p><h3>I posted a video for binidi a few months ago and I just felt like my favorite
    dish deserved more. I think these 5 tips are truly so much more important than the 
    actual recipe, because I know everyone makes it a different way, but I have
    the receipe below as well!</h3></p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1lb of okra / bindi, cut in round bite sized pieces</li>
        <li>1 small red onion</li>
        <li>1 medium tomato</li>
        <li>3 green chillies</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp coriander powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp turmeric</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp red chili powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add cumin seeds to half a tbsp of hot oil in cast iron pan.</li>
        <li>Once the seeds start "dancing", add onions and green chilies. Saute 
            on low-medium heat.</li>
        <li>After about a minute, add bindi, tumeric, coriander, and red chili powder.
            Mix well (but gently) and leave on medium-high heat until you get a 
            nice char. Mix to get the other sides occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add a sprinkle of salt, tomatoes, mix well, and cover with a lid for 
            approx. 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, you can give it one more gentle mix. Serve with some roti
            or some dal and rice!</li>
    </ol>
