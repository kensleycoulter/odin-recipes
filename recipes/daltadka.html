            <h5>Dal Tadka</h5>

    <h3><p>It's not lentil soup or lentil dal it's just dal - period. I was having a
        hard time choosing which of my momâ€™s many dal recipes to share 
        (she legit made a different dal every night), and I landed with this
        easy Dal Tadka (also known as chhonk or tempering spices) with a blend of 
        moong and masoor lentils, mainly because it cooks so quickly and it's super 
        adjustable.</p></h3>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>         
            <li>1 cup yellow moong dal</li>
            <li>1/2 cup red masoor dal</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>3 green chilies</li>
            <li>2 tomatoes</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp tumeric powder</li>
            <li>1.5 tsp coriander powder</li>
            <li>salt</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the first eight ingredients to your pressure cooker.</li>
            <li>Set pressure cook settings to sealing, High, Natural Release, 7 minutes</li>
            <li>Wait for pressure to release, after 10 min if the pressure valve hasn't
                dropped, manually release the remaining pressure. Check to see if the consistency
                is how you like it! </li>
            <li>Start on your tadka/chhonk (temper your spices) using a tiny tadka pan
                or small frying pan. Add ghee or avacado oil and get it very hot.</li>
            <li>Add the rest of the ingredients gradually. Mixing or swirling when
                when needed to combine.</li>
            <li>Top with lime or cilantro, and enjoy with basmati rice!</li>
        </ol>
